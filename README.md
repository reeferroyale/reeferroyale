1. Ying Yang · Andre Gazolla · Antonio Farhy

An almost perfect Psytech song. Tons of attitude, both in the beat and the lyrics. Special quality, excellent voice processing.

2.
Folic State - Falling State (Ash Roy Remix)
Not only one of the best psytech songs I’ve found, but one of the best songs overall. Played a set with many of my favorite tracks, some included in this list, but this one stood out. Also, it gets better the more you turn up the volume—production quality is insane.
A bit of a minus for weaker lyrics; they kind of fit but could go harder.

3.
Kaufmann (DE) - Self Control
As heavy as a remix can go—an ’80s classic in the hardest wrap ever. Goes insanely hard live on big speakers too. Nice chopping of vocals.
4.
Smooth Criminal - The New World
Reigning champion of heaviest drop and beat at 1:00 in—hits like a ton of bricks. Excellent progression afterward. Corny vocals, but they fit perfectly. Second drop could hit harder.

5.
David Phoenix - Portal (Kaufmann Remix)
Total Goa influence, with a very gangster vibe more than spiritual. The buildup at the beginning and before the drop is a bit too long. If the drop hit harder, it would be more acceptable. Still a great song.
6.
Miles from Mars - Gangsta's Paradise
The first "real" hip-hop-psytech crossover. Heavy AF, could be even heavier with more lyrics from the original song and better progression. A bit anti-climactic towards the end.
7.
Lui Mafuta - Double Double Shake Shake (Deep Ändi Remix)
A real battle-tested song, seen crazy things. Dirty ass lyrics, real gangsta. Beat goes kind of weak compared to the vocals and highs and mids.
8.
Vakabular, Red Machine - Turn Off The Heat (Extended Mix)
More dirty ass lyrics, real real good voice. Excellent beat, but way too slow. Really comes to life when you lift the BPM a bit.

9.
Juan Carlos B - Girls Never Sleep (Original Mix)
Insane find and use of lyrics. Beat goes crazy hard, insane drops. Could be longer and filled with something more.

10.
Oriss, Adam Sellouk - Protocol (Original Mix)
Bit of a generic sound, but within that generic sound, dead hard lyrics and vibe. Goes hard. Would be interesting to hear a bit less generic on the beat. Real car chase feeling.
11.
Space Motion - Silver Screen
Nice reuse of lyrics from a more famous song. Really fucking nice lyrics in feeling. Beat goes hard for its style, but still, would be interesting to hear on something much more proper. Even highs and mids are harder than the bassline.

12.
EYNKA - Wildfire
Once again, great lyrics. Maybe a bit weak voice? Bit of a generic beat, but still a strong song.

13.
Techdeej - Darkness
One of the best progressed psytech tracks produced. The progression/build-up is 10/10. Lyrics fit a bit generic but still work. One of my most played tracks of 2023.
14.
Duppeditt, Faia - Small Beings
Extremely good beat, 100% psytech rolling. Bit generic lyrics and voices used. Would roll even harder with something cooler. But still top 5 of Music 4 Aliens releases.

15.
Deniz Bul - Vibin
Really nice use of a voice and a rolling sample. Great buildups.

16.
Juelz - The Abyss
Former reigning champion of best bassline. A bit strange and weird lyrics, a bit too dark and too little attitude. Still changes a room when played because of the insane bassline. A real bazooka.
17.
Pastiche - It's Wavy
Corny and sexy but still kind of works, interesting being a release on Phobos. Still would be interesting with an even harder beat.

18.
Rupt & Logic Cycle - Random Flow
Another song with an excellent soundscape, progression, and vibe. 100% hard. Feels full without any lyrics because of the excellent production.

19.
Maksim Dark - Glocken Läuten (Pavel Petrov Remix)
Excellent use of German lyrics. Still goes a bit slow and lacks a bit of punch. Can be fixed by turning up the volume live, but still room for improvement.
20.
Maksim Dark - Bleeper
So hard, so minimal, so cool, perfect lyrics, perfect wooohing bass instrument on top of everything. Fantastic production.

21.
Reefer Decree - Reefer Royal
The song that gave me my artist name. Under a silent night in the middle of nowhere, I heard that melody again & again in my head. One of the greatest melodies ever—so catchy, cool, great progression, and use of the track as well. Would be very interesting to hear this kind of melody with a harder bassline.

22.
Grand Avenue - Almost Gone (Reefer Decree Remix)
Amazing full song with lyrics. The melody style from Reefer Royal with the frustrated cool lyrics, connecting to driving feels. Great vibes. Became a friend's most-played song on Spotify 2022 after I played it in a set in February 2022 and he saved the ID.
23.
La Kajofol - Snake Charmer
A venture into Tekno/Tribe. A very good example. Inducing genre if done with the right groove. Would be very interesting to hear more.

24.
Moe & Melmixx - Shaman Flow
A true 10/10, signature song for me, strongest memory playing this and doing some showmanship to it. Extremely well-produced beat, lyrics, vibe—everything. Spiritual but still has gangster feels.

25.
Peter Gun - Ebrium
I'm ready to die on the hill that this is the best Swedish-produced bassline still, even though there are strong contenders. Another showcase of excellent track progression and buildup. Feels full without vocals.
26.
Colyn - Future is the Past
Very cool subtle feel, a bit 80s, a bit tech house, a bit progressive house. Bit generic lyrics, but they kind of fit. Not the strongest bassline or maxed-out progression.

27.
Kohra & SHFT - Tonight's Game
BADASS lyrics and voice, perfection. 100% Car Chase Records vibe. A bit dated sound, lacks maybe the last gear. But such an excellent track overall.

28.
Mochakk & HAAS - Caribbean Queen
Badass remix of an epic original song. Wouldn't mind it a notch darker. Track structure could be a bit better.
29.
Joseph Disco & Lampé - Gasoline
Great bassline, amazing lyrics once again, 100% spot-on with the vibe. Could be a bit more creative on the structure; definitely has 1-2 gears more. Big break is a bit weak, and the tone on top of it feels very anxious instead of confident.

30.
Christian Craken - Instinct Shake (Club ShakerZ & Virag Cover Full Version)
A masterclass in contrast, one of the best bootlegs. Darkest beat with a sexy voice and pop style, 100% cool. This is what Pastiche - Its Wavy could reach. Way too short and lacks a bit of structure and production value though.

31.
Peter Groskreutz - House Of The Dying Sun (Original Mix)
Crazy confident, not afraid to take out the turns at all. 100% a song I would love to play in a car chase. Feels full without vocals because of the high production level.

32.
Hatikwa - No Sacrifice, No Victory!
Hatikwa is Hatikwa. Excellent atmosphere. 11-minute blast by. Bit weak lyrics.

33.
Inyourphaze - Get Out of Here
100% Gangster Pusher Street Progressive. Bit lo-fi on the production but insane melody and groove throughout. Perfect minimal lyric at the exact right moment.

34.
Yello - The Race (Arctic Moon 'Bootleg' Remix)
Insane bootleg on the coolest original track. Insane sounds, 5:30 true to the original but still evolved.
35.
The Prodigy - Breathe (Victor Ruiz Bootleg) (Extended)
More bootleg gold, battle-tested on the most insane Funktion One Yamaha rig ($70k+). A bit weak still, considering the original, lacks a bit of structure. Drop at 3:50 is insane, but what follows could be longer and more in tune with the song.

36.
Vibrasphere - Isolation (Hidra Remix)
Another progressive house masterpiece. The melody and progression are flawless. Ethereal but still gangster.

37.
Boris Brechja - Moondancer
Couldn't listen to any other techno track for months after I found it. A true masterpiece. Even though it’s on the sadder side, it's carried by a very forward, blazing bassline. Excellent slow buildup as well, making the song a surprise without being boring up until that point.

38.
Plastic Robots, Tesla - The Cats
Very dated bassline but still an excellently built track. Definitely the best music video for a psytech/techno song that I've seen. Last drop is crazy, but I wanted more of the heavy sound—it fades too fast.
39.
Veerus & Maxie Devine - The Sound
Very experimental track, I don't know how to categorize it. Excellent choices of sound overall. Doesn’t sound dated, still very fresh after 11 years. Maybe lacks an element like a vocal to give it one more gear. Almost a bit of a dub/rasta feeling.

40.
Domased Electronica - Temple Of Art (LoQuai Remix)
Progressive house masterpiece. Maybe the best progressive house song in my book. Melodies, bassline, progression, production—everything. Also ethereal but still gangster.

41.
Fabio & Moon - All So Simple
Excellent groove and lyrics. A bit basic in production otherwise, but a strong core.

42.
Krama - Gothbeat
Such a gangster song, being a progressive psytrack with that vocal and that groove. Again, 100% CCR vibe. This is an example of how timeless the right sound can be. While a lot of other progressive sounds have dated, including the Fabio & Moon track above, this one still kicks on all gears. Definitely my favorite vocal on all progressive psy tracks.
43.
Junior Jack - It Must Be the Darkness
Excellent house track. Insane use of guitar. Perfect vocals and lyrics. One of my favorite songs to pop on at both a pre-party or an after-party.

44.
Cu Cap - World Trade Center
Feeling fresh while still being retro, the first  artist on the label. Excellent vocals and good melody. Maybe needs a bit of mastering.

45.
Multi Tul - Polyzero x Joyner Lucas - Revenge (Reefer Royale Edit)
I won’t review my own track other than it goes hard live, especially at the end.

46.
Tamexican, Climbers & Dali - Otra Noche
Excellent vibe and production value. Could be a harder bassline, though.
47.
Luke Colborn - Dark Prince
Crazy production. Excellent vibes and progression. Could be a bit longer and have a more intricate track structure, like Inferno or House of the Dying Sun. Insane sounds, especially the guitar-sounding stuff.

48.
Luke Colborn - Drunk Pistoleiro
Much better track structure than Dark Prince. Excellent progression and production value. Maybe feels a little too minimal and could benefit from something more in the sounds. However, a really good track. Goes very hard live too.

49.
Egorythmia vs. Ace Ventura - White Tunnel
The masterpiece of progressive psytracks? Insanely psychedelic but still gangster and not corny psychedelic. Extremely confident song, taking every corner with 100% confidence.

50.
Gooutonahinote - Virus
My friend and master wizard. Dwelling into the forest side of psy. Excellent production value. Bass change at 3:38 is glorious. Spooky soundscapes but still confident.

51.
Eartha Harris - Mountain To Stars
Sexiest downtempo song I've heard in years. Could benefit by even playing it a bit slower. But such lovely soundscapes—confident, sexy, yet still relaxing. The kind of song you feel you could really push the speedometer on the car while being in a flow state. Feels like the producer still has several gears left.

52.
Schwarz & Funk - Sky Is the Limit (Sunseeker Mix)
A house song that has everything. Groove. The most soothing vocal with the most uplifting message. Insane guitar. Personally, the last song I just did that with, pushing the speedometer in a flow state—maybe the last run on summer tires this year. Glorious. Not maybe the genre we’re looking to release on CCR, but who knows. Still a perfect house track to study.

53.
Sunstryk - Leaving Eden
Excellent production on everything, but track progression really sucks. Never took off as a song because of it. Still a good framework for nice-sounding progressive psy.

54.
Eli Brown - Believe (Original Mix)
A song that has taken off. Is nothing without the lyrics. An example of how simple lyrics can make the whole thing.

55.
Mac Vaughn - Pink Is My Favorite Color (Khainz Remix)
A really tight bassline with cool, understated lyrics. This is bassline groove at its finest. Its melody is so catchy. My most played track of 2022 on Spotify—it just sticks.

56.
Dr. Oscillator - Cocaine (Original Mix)
An example of how a song with crazy lyrics can create crazy situations. Too long for what it is, but those lyrics go hard.

57.
Lunatica & Virtual Light - Xanadu
Progression from 04:00 - 06:10 is masterful. Crazy soundscape-level design. This is psytrance done right—working on scales that need to be done more in psytech/techno, etc.

58.
Vasvi - Forest Mafia
First real proper forest psytech song? Excellent production. Maybe could have a bit more attitude.

59.
OxyFlux - Try A Little Tenderness
The best psytrance track produced in the last five years. Goes insanely hard. Cool af lyrics that fit perfectly. Crazy sound production—fast, yet still high-quality overall.
60.
Jay Lumen - Here We Go
Heavy re-work on an absolute classic. Lacks a bit of creativity but still inspiring to put such a hard bassline on it.

61.
LTJ Xperience - Black Feeling
Crazy slow vibe. 100% vibe. Definitely something that could be an intro track on a CCR record. Very gangster vibe.

62.
Aphe - Nautilus
Crazy track if you play it on a small system or earphones. Insane progression. However, it falls apart when you turn the volume up—maybe it’s fixable?

63.
Kohra - Dust Particle (Jitter Remix)
Long-time favorite. Played it in my first set. Insane release for being from 2012, way ahead of its time. Almost white tunnel-level progression. Can also be played live with a lot and still always sounds good. Crazy production.

64.
Olga Korol & Per Hammar - Darth Vader
Weak bassline, but very good use of vocals. Very good car chase cop gif on Spotify. Badass lyrics. Needs a remix, hard!

65.
LXST CXNTURY - ODIUM
Real big Phonk song. Crazy vocal production. Would go hard in Psytech.

66.
2Pac - From the East to West (feat. Freddie Gibbs)
An example of how a post-death track can go so hard. 100% attitude. Example of hard rap lyrics and chorus.

67.
Rebolledo - Discótico Desértico (by Paulor)
Excellent slow progression and use of guitar. Feels like something epic is coming when listening—like the perfect dark-room empty scene before the band or DJ goes up.

68.
Face Papi - Aladin
My favorite intro song from 2024. Excellent mystic theme. Both gangster and mystic. Lacks a bit of extra gears after the mid-drop, while the second drop before it is insane. Could have better lyrics or none at all. Haunting melody.

69.
Corsini - Actuator
Relentless minimal, like a perfect runner. The chase is on with this song. Crazy lyrics, not sure if they fit.

70.
The Beatangers - Nigga Who
Gangsta shit. Weak, dated bassline.

71.
Chase & Status - Baddadan
An prime example of how lyrics can take something to the next level. One of the biggest hits of 2023? There's a Swedish version that goes hard, showing that the beat itself is top-level too. Different genre than CCR is looking for, but still, the production value is there. Badass music video too.

72.
Infected Mushroom - Heavyweight
Craziest "guitar" solo in an electronic song. Very chase-friendly.

73.
Ticon - 1987
80s but not cheesy. Fantastic production. Great progression. And use of side sounds.

74.
Torii Wolf - Shadows Crawl ft. DJ Premier
Hard-ass female lyrics and voice.

75.
UNAVERAGE GANG - UNDERWORLD
Hard-ass SoundCloud rap shit. "The wolf climbing the hill is already on top hard as rock" quote. Still not the best song, but good voices and a good line here and there.

76.
Arenna - Metamorphosis in Ic (0.9168 g/cm³)
Example of progression and length in a Stoner Rock song. Imagine some kind of version of this with soundscapes from Heavyweight, Mooncalf, Discótico Desértico, and other songs mentioned.

77.
Vibrasphere - Floating Free
One of the greats. One of the first electronic tracks that really blew my mind. Sounds a bit dated but still takes you places.

78.
Astin - Black Panthers (Albert Marzinotto Remix)
House with a gangster edge to it. Feels a bit dangerous.

79.
Ovnimoon · Zyce - Stereo Space (Float Remix)
Another song in the style of Floating Free. Doesn't really reach the same quality, especially in track structure, but still a very driving bassline.

80.
Crocoloko - Alice In Wonderland
Quite an overrated track in itself, but contains some crazy soundscapes (the desert vibe) that need to be visited by others. Between 02:00 - 05:00.

81.
$UICIDEBOY$ - MOUNT SINAI
Hardest SoundCloud rap song ever. Lyrics are so hard, you might end up behind bars even though they’re straight mumbo jumbo.

82.
Metallica - Enter Sandman (SHRED VERSION) Sophie Lloyd
Excellent use of guitar. Replacing vocal notes with an instrument is very interesting for production.

83.
Jay C & Felix Baumgartner - Souk (Original Mix)
Use of oriental tones but still holding it gangster and not sounding like old Turkic/Persian/Arabic dad music. Hasn’t aged well otherwise, but was a banger when it came out.

84.
Dope Lemon - Salt & Pepper
Slow, melancholic, but still gangster. Excellent video. Goes harder than you think.

85.
Rammstein - Dalai Lama (Instrumental Cover)
A testament to Rammstein's production. Dropped this on a dancefloor, confusion but it went hard. Excellent sounds overall here, with notes of Heavyweight on the guitar. Insanely hard riffs.

86.
Silvana Imam - Tänd Alla Ljus
A testament that Swedish music can be filled with attitude. Hard video. Very creative beat and style for hip-hop. Excellent mix of female and male distorted vocals.

87.
Moshic - Gold Rivers (Vlada D'Shake Remix)
Excellent progressive house with attitude. Maybe an unnecessary sound here and there. Would benefit by being more minimal.

88.
Linius ft. Kordas - BLACK BIMMER
Hard lyrics, but a crap song.

89.
Skeler - Tel Aviv
The uncrowned king of this kind of electronica. Melancholic but still insanely confident and hard. Crazy video, 100% vibe. Way too short and could have had more insane progressions.

90.
Far & High - Sans Vetements (Plastic Robots Remix)
Crazy-ass mumbo jumbo capitalistic lyrics that go hard. A bit of a Pink Panther feel on the drop. Really nice voice processing. Could go even harder and have an even cooler structure.
91.
Metallica - Wherever I May Roam
A song with 100% attitude in it. Nice tempos. Makes you wanna outrun the police. The focus here is the attitude and riffs.

92.
California Dreamin' - Eddie Hazel (Cover by Phillydoc)
100% feel; either you have it or you don’t. Phillydoc will be a 100% associate on Car Chase Records, and we’ll make sure to get him the proper recording equipment to record licks and play on songs.

93.
Ozric Tentacles - Mooncalf
Crazy song. Talking about licks, the guitar from 1:30 - 2:40 is my favourite part of this song. Crazy structure overall, with a dub breakdown in the middle of it all.

94.
B.A.N.D.O · Nocide · L4RRY - Infernal
A masterclass in Psytech. This is like MMA or some shit. Aggressive, creative, violent.

95.
Astrix - Beyond the Senses
Another masterclass. Crazy soundscapes. Nice chopped vocals. Tribal but still a gangster feeling. Crazy song for the car at fast speeds.

96.
Ace Ventura - Dark Matter (Egorythmia Remix)
Not overall the best song, but the break at 3:15 and the drop after that goes harder than any other progressive song ever achieved. Truly dark matter was achieved.

97.
YVC - Piece of Mind (8kicks)
Overall quite a good song but contains the best higher notes from a psytech song in 2024. The glitchy almost immediately at 0:22 and continuing for a while. Crazy sound.

98.
Oliver Huntemann - Tranquilizer (Christian Craken Remix)
Not alone in liking this song. Played it at a festival where a guy came up, had lost his phone and everything, but wrote down the track ID on a bit of gaffa tape — dedication. Still a bit overrated but can't be denied. Very driving bassline, though the mids and highs are a bit mediocre.

99.
Rachel Raw, Suspect One - Mars (Carbon & Lampe Remix)
100% party; this is Fabio Moon but in techno style. Still think "Pink Is My Favorite Color" is more groovy than this, but it’s a close race between two very similar songs.

100.
Victor Ameln · Von Dahl - Confusion (Co-Existence Remix)
The best release on Romklang Records. Insane production, very crisp. Very good build. A nice use of scaling later in the song that makes it worthwhile to listen to the whole song as it gets better and better. Misfitting vocals are the only critique I can give.
